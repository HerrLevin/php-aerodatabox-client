 * AeroDataBox API
 *
 * **AeroDataBox API** is an enthusiast-driven cost-effective aviation and flight data API tailored for small and medium businesses, individual developers, researchers, and students. It offers a wide range of data, including flight status, schedules, aircraft information, airport details, statistics, historical data, and more. Designed for seamless integration using REST and web hooks and available through major API marketplaces, it enables users to incorporate aviation information effortlessly into their systems at affordable rates.  ## Sign Up Access AeroDataBox API for a price of a cup of coffee!  Sign up through one of the supported API marketplaces, each offering various pricing models to suit your specific needs. - **[RapidAPI](https://rapid.aerodatabox.com/) - most tried & tested** - **[API.Market](https://apimarket.aerodatabox.com/) - free plan available** - **[Sulu Hub](https://sulu.aerodatabox.com/) - pay-per-use, no subscription, crypto accepted**  Pricing details for each marketplace can be found on the [pricing page](https://aerodatabox.com/pricing).  ## Follow Updates  Our API constantly evolves! Visit our [web-site](https://aerodatabox.com) and join our newsletter to stay in the loop.  Recent updates can be found on the [News & Updates](https://aerodatabox.com/news) page  ## Must-Reads * **⚠️ [Terms of Use](https://aerodatabox.com/terms) &lt;- BY SUBSCRIBING TO THE API YOU AUTOMATICALLY ACCEPT THESE TERMS** * **⚠️ [Pricing](https://aerodatabox.com/pricing)  &lt;- CALLS ARE NOT PRICED EQUALLY** * **⚠️ [Data Coverage](https://aerodatabox.com/data-coverage) &lt;- BE AWARE OF OUR LIMITATIONS** * [Documentation & OpenAPI Specification](https://doc.aerodatabox.com/ ) * [FAQ](https://aerodatabox.com/faq) * [For Students & Researchers](https://aerodatabox.com/students)  ## API Supported Response Formats * JSON (default, `Accept: application/json`) * XML (`Accept: application/xml`)  ## API Features  ### Flights API  🗓️ FIDS & Schedules *(the list of current, future, and historical flights operating in a specific airport)*  🗓️ Flight Status (single day) *(current, future, and historical data about a specific flight operating on a specific or nearest date, found by flight number, ATC call-sign, aircraft registration, or 24-bit ICAO Mode-S address)*  🗓️ Flight History & Schedule (range of dates) *(the list of current, future, and historical flights operating within a specific range of dates, found by flight number, ATC call-sign, aircraft registration, or 24-bit ICAO Mode-S address)*  🗓️ Flight Departure / Arrival Dates *(dates when a flight operates, found by flight number, ATC call sign, aircraft registration, or 24-bit ICAO Mode-S address)*  🗓️ Search Flight Numbers By Term *(lookup available flight numbers by term - useful for implmenting auto-complete features)*  ### Flight Alert API 🔔 *PUSH API powered by webhooks.

AeroDataBox is a niche enthusiast-driven aviation and flights API with [certain limitations](https://aerodatabox.com/data-coverage) that we openly communicate. We do our best to under-promise and over-deliver. But is an enthusiast-driven API good for your case anyway? That depends!  If you’re developing a small or medium business (SMB / SME) or an application developer who does not require a tough service-level agreement (SLA) or an exhaustive worldwide coverage, our API is just right for you! However, at this point we discourage (and even [do not allow](https://aerodatabox.com/terms) in some cases) using our API for mission-critical or enterprise-level products where people may be hurt or severe damage can occur if the API fails for any reason.  Having said that, we’re are working hard to improve this. We expect to implement SLAs and direct access to our API and other data services with extra stability and high availability under special premium terms soon. Read more in our [FAQ](https://aerodatabox.com/faq).  If you need it earlier or should you have special needs, please do [contact us](https://aerodatabox.com/contact) and tell us your story! We already have a record of implementing custom solutions tailored for needs of our customers.  ## Support  For direct contact, please reach out to us via e-mail at info@aerodatabox.com.  Before sending a message, please take some time to review the documentation and must-read website pages (at least data coverage and FAQ). These pages address roughly 80% of the questions we receive on day-to-day basis.  ## API Availability Last 7 days  ![](https://app.statuscake.com/button/index.php?Track=1iySKWJj1E&amp;Days=7&amp;Design=2)  Last 30 days  ![](https://app.statuscake.com/button/index.php?Track=1iySKWJj1E&amp;Days=30&amp;Design=2)  [Uptime Status](https://status.aerodatabox.com)  ## Endpoint Labes 🤖 - endpoint uses or may use AI/ML algorithms  `[TIER 1]..[TIER 4]` - the tier level of the endpoint, where TIER 4 is the highest and TIER 1 is the lowest. The tier level is used to determine the pricing of the endpoint. Depending on the marketplace, different pricing models may be used, but you can expect that higher tier endpoints will be more expensive than lower tier endpoints.  `[FREE TIER]` - the endpoint is available for free on all marketplaces.  Pricing details can be found on the [pricing page](https://aerodatabox.com/pricing).
